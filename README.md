Mother of All Sample Apps
-------

This is my attempt at improving the default app experience when developing for Windows Phone and Windows store apps. I attempt to follow the Mvvm guidelines using the MvvmLight library, and implement some standard project structures and classes that I use when creating Windows Phone apps. This way I can consolidate all my previous app's improvements for my next app.

The project is mostly functional. I've mainly been experimenting on the JsonRpcModelsLibrary so that I can develop some set of useful features there, but there's still a ways to go before it's perfect (like always). 

I will add more to the core MASA as I develop more applications.
